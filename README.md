# NovaIDE 🚀  
### An AI-Powered Online IDE with Real-Time Sync and Autonomous AI Agents

> **I built an AI-powered online IDE where an AI agent can design project structure, modify code using tool-calling, run it instantly in the browser, and keep everything real-time synced across users.**

NovaIDE is a modern, web-based code editor inspired by tools like Cursor and Replit.  
It combines a powerful in-browser IDE, real-time collaboration, and AI agents that can safely generate, edit, and execute code using structured tool-calling.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** Next.js + CodeMirror-based IDE  
- **State Layer:** Convex as the real-time source of truth  
- **AI Layer:** Claude with structured tool-calling  
- **Execution:** WebContainers for in-browser Node.js runtime  
- **Jobs:** Inngest for background AI tasks  
- **Auth & Billing:** Clerk  
- **Monitoring:** Sentry  

> The AI agent never edits files directly — all changes go through explicit, auditable file manipulation tools.
